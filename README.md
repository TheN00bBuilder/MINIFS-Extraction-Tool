# extract_minifs.py

A simple Python script to extract MiniFS filesystems from TP-Link VxWorks devices.

These are typically characterized by the magic "MINIFS".

I based my parser loosely off this paper, making a few changes where I saw fit for my device. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05064

This worked on the latest RE200 V5.0 firmware.

## Usage
